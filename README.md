# CPS-MeasurerClicker
Clicks per second

I made this in python 2 years ago! This is unchanged code from 2 years ago.
- The Measurer is a GUI made with tkinter
- Clicker requires numba, mouse, keyboard and uses threads (:

Note: I made this before I knew OOP. The code is very messy and uses "global".
